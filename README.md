This is my Zelda mini game, a little project in which I've been experimenting because I would like to study coding in a future.
You have it right here, so you can just enter and try it. Share it with your friends if you like it! Don't forget to tell me what you think :)

Of course, The Legend of Zelda does not belong to me. This is just a fan creation made by a teenager, so it's made with ZERO commercial intentions.
Please enjoy the game and thank you so much for playing <3
